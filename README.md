# Overview

In this project, we investigate the impact that dosage levels and delivery methods of Vitamin C may or may not have on the growth of guinea pig teeth. The data comes from the "ToothGrowth" set in the {datasets} package in R.

## Description

The response is the length of odontoblasts (teeth) in each of 10 guinea pigs at each of three dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg) with each of two delivery methods (orange juice or ascorbic acid).

## Format

A data frame with 60 observations on 3 variables.

1. len numeric Tooth length
2. supp factor Supplement type (VC or OJ).
3. dose numeric Dose in milligrams.
